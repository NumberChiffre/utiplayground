# Plan Summary — Daniel Kim Escalation

## Summary
Decision: refer_complicated
Consensus: Escalate to human (interrupt)
Prescriber Sign-off Required: Yes

### Key Reasoning
- The patient is a 35-year-old male presenting with classic lower urinary tract symptoms—dysuria and urgency—without fever, flank pain, or other systemic or upper-tract features, suggesting a cystitis-level infection.
- Male sex is an established complicating factor for UTI management, as underlying anatomical or functional abnormalities are more likely, and empirical management is not guideline supported without further physician assessment.
- Absence of red flags such as fever, rigors, flank pain, or systemic features reduces the immediate concern for pyelonephritis or urosepsis, but does not eliminate the need for escalation due to male sex.
- He has no history of recurrent UTI, recent antibiotic exposure, catheter use, immunocompromise, or significant comorbidities, narrowing the differential and making complicated lower UTI the most likely diagnosis.
- Current guidelines and Ontario College of Pharmacists algorithm require referral for all male patients with UTI symptoms due to increased risk of complications and need for tailored diagnostic and management strategies.

### Algorithm Rationale
- This patient presents with complicating factors that preclude pharmacist-initiated antibiotic therapy: male sex, which increases complexity and risk of complications.
- According to the Ontario College of Pharmacists UTI assessment algorithm, patients with any complicating factors should be referred to a physician or nurse practitioner for comprehensive evaluation and management.
- These factors increase the risk of treatment failure, complications, and the need for alternative diagnostic approaches or specialized antimicrobial regimens.
