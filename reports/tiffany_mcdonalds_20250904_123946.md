## Summary
Decision: refer_recurrence
Consensus: Escalate to human (interrupt)
Prescriber Sign-off Required: Yes

### Key Reasoning
- This 35-year-old female presents with classic lower urinary tract symptoms—dysuria, urgency, and frequency—without any red flags, making simple cystitis likely at the symptom level.
- Absence of fever, flank pain, rigors, nausea/vomiting, or systemic symptoms effectively excludes pyelonephritis and complicated UTI, eliminating immediate escalation or urgent referral triggers.
- The patient reports no hematuria or suprapubic pain, further supporting an isolated bladder infection rather than more extensive involvement.
- However, the clinical threshold for recurrent UTI is met, as she has had at least two episodes within six months or three or more in a year, which necessitates specialist assessment per guideline recommendations.
- She has received antibiotics in the past 90 days, a key risk modifier for antimicrobial resistance, making empiric treatment selection challenging without susceptibility data or specialist review.
- Normal renal function, absence of immunocompromise or urinary instrumentation, and lack of pregnancy reduce risk for rapid progression or atypical presentation, supporting outpatient assessment over emergent action.
- No allergies or current medication use simplifies the safety profile, but the history and recurrence pattern warrant further investigation for underlying risk factors such as anatomic abnormality, resistant pathogen, or non-infectious etiology.

### Algorithm Rationale
- This patient has experienced 2 or more UTI episodes within the past 6 months, meeting the definition for recurrent urinary tract infection.
- According to the Ontario College of Pharmacists UTI algorithm, patients experiencing relapse or recurrent infections should be referred to a physician or nurse practitioner for comprehensive evaluation.
- Recurrent UTIs may indicate underlying anatomical abnormalities, functional disorders, antimicrobial resistance, or other predisposing factors that require specialized investigation and management beyond the scope of pharmacist-initiated therapy.
