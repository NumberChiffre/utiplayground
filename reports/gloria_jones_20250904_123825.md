## Summary
Decision: refer_complicated
Consensus: Escalate to human (interrupt)
Prescriber Sign-off Required: Yes

### Key Reasoning
- The patient presents with typical lower urinary tract symptoms (dysuria, frequency, suprapubic pain) but also endorses red flag symptoms including fever and flank pain, which strongly suggest upper urinary tract involvement, such as pyelonephritis.
- The absence of recent antibiotic exposure, immunocompromised status, or structural urologic abnormalities slightly lowers the likelihood of resistant or atypical pathogens but does not reduce the risk posed by her current severe presentation.
- Sulfa allergy limits options for empiric oral antibiotics for uncomplicated cystitis, but this is moot in the current context because her clinical status exceeds the threshold for community-based empiric therapy.
- Normal renal function and lack of contraindications to fluoroquinolones or beta-lactams inform potential parenteral regimens, should hospitalization be required after specialist assessment.
- The co-occurrence of fever and flank pain explicitly meets IDSA criteria for complicated UTI (pyelonephritis), mandating escalation of care to a higher level than pharmacy-based management.
- While stable vital signs are not explicitly documented, the presence of systemic symptoms such as fever and the risk for rapid deterioration justify urgent referral.
- She is on lisinopril, which interacts with certain antibiotics (e.g., trimethoprim), but this risk is secondary clinical importance compared to the necessity for urgent referral and evaluation for potential sepsis or abscess.

### Algorithm Rationale
- This patient presents with complicating factors that preclude pharmacist-initiated antibiotic therapy: upper urinary tract or systemic disease with red flag symptoms including fever, rigors, flank pain, back pain, nausea, or vomiting.
- According to the Ontario College of Pharmacists UTI assessment algorithm, patients with any complicating factors should be referred to a physician or nurse practitioner for comprehensive evaluation and management.
- These factors increase the risk of treatment failure, complications, and the need for alternative diagnostic approaches or specialized antimicrobial regimens.
