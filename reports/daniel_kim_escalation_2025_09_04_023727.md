# Plan Summary — Daniel Kim Escalation

## Summary
Decision: refer_complicated
Consensus: Escalate to human (interrupt)

### Key Reasoning
- This 35-year-old male presents with classic lower urinary tract symptoms—dysuria and urgency—without systemic symptoms or red flag indicators such as fever, rigors, flank pain, or nausea/vomiting.
- Male sex is a recognized complicating factor in urinary tract infection management, associated with increased risk for underlying urological abnormalities, prostatitis, and treatment failure; guidelines recommend referral rather than pharmacist-initiated empiric therapy.
- The absence of recurrence, prior antibiotic exposure, or immunosuppression reduces the risk of multi-drug resistance and rare pathogens, but does not negate the need for further diagnostic evaluation given the patient's demographic.
- Current clinical presentation does not fulfill criteria for severe infection or acute pyelonephritis, as there are no systemic symptoms or flank pain, supporting outpatient evaluation but not empiric therapy.
- There are no drug allergies, renal dysfunction, or comorbidities significantly impacting immediate management, but the potential for prostatic involvement or complicated etiology in males mandates referral for urine culture, diagnostic imaging consideration, and possibly tailored antibiotic therapy.

### Algorithm Rationale
- This patient presents with complicating factors that preclude pharmacist-initiated antibiotic therapy: male sex, which increases complexity and risk of complications.
- According to the Ontario College of Pharmacists UTI assessment algorithm, patients with any complicating factors should be referred to a physician or nurse practitioner for comprehensive evaluation and management.
- These factors increase the risk of treatment failure, complications, and the need for alternative diagnostic approaches or specialized antimicrobial regimens.
