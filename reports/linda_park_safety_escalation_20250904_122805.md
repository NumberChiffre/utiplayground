# Plan Summary — Linda Park Safety Escalation

## Summary
Decision: recommend_treatment
Consensus: Escalate to human (validator fail)
Prescriber Sign-off Required: Yes
Safety: conditional (moderate)

### Key Reasoning
- 52-year-old woman with classic lower UTI symptoms (dysuria, urgency) and no upper tract/systemic features meeting criteria for uncomplicated cystitis per guidelines.
- No fever, flank pain, rigors, or systemic illness—low suspicion for pyelonephritis or sepsis, appropriate for outpatient management.
- No immunosuppression, anatomical abnormalities, or urinary instrumentation; infection risk is not increased for unusual/complicated pathogens.
- Allergy to nitrofurantoin mandates use of alternative agent; sulfa allergies not documented, so TMP-SMX remains an option.
- Medications include spironolactone (potassium-sparing diuretic) and ibuprofen (NSAID), both interacting with TMP-SMX for potassium and renal risk.
- No ACEI/ARB use and normal renal function—relative risk for hyperkalemia is moderate but not prohibitive; close monitoring is essential.
- Recent ibuprofen (NSAID) heightens acute kidney injury risk with TMP-SMX and spironolactone; limit duration and advise hydration.
- TMP-SMX is guideline-recommended for uncomplicated cystitis but must be paired here with stringent serum potassium/creatinine monitoring and patient counseling.

### Algorithm Rationale
- This patient meets the diagnostic criteria for acute uncomplicated cystitis based on their symptom presentation.
- No complicating factors were identified that would preclude pharmacist-initiated treatment.
- No recurrence or relapse pattern was detected based on the patient's UTI history.
- Based on the patient's clinical profile and the Ontario College of Pharmacists UTI algorithm, Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole has been selected as the most appropriate first-line treatment option.
