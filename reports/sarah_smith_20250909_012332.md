# Plan Summary — Sarah Smith

## Summary
Decision: recommend_treatment
Consensus: Nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID x 5 days
Prescriber Sign-off Required: Yes
Safety: approve (low)

### Key Reasoning
- This 28-year-old woman presents with classic lower urinary tract symptoms, including dysuria and urgency, with no red flag features suggestive of upper tract involvement or systemic infection.
- There is a total absence of fever, rigors, flank pain, nausea, vomiting, or other systemic symptoms, effectively ruling out pyelonephritis or urosepsis and making escalation unnecessary at this time.
- Her history lacks risk factors for complicated UTI, including immunocompromised state, recent antibiotic use, recurrent UTI pattern, pregnancy, or anatomical abnormalities such as catheterization or kidney stones.
- Her normal renal function supports the safe use of nitrofurantoin, which is contraindicated in patients with reduced eGFR (<30 mL/min).
- No allergy, medication contraindication, or drug interaction risk was identified, supporting a first-line regimen in accordance with evidence-based guidelines for uncomplicated cystitis in premenopausal, non-pregnant women.
- Current data show no warning signs or significant comorbidities that would mandate physician referral or empiric broad-spectrum therapy.

### Algorithm Rationale
- This patient meets the diagnostic criteria for acute uncomplicated cystitis based on their symptom presentation.
- No complicating factors were identified that would preclude pharmacist-initiated treatment.
- No recurrence or relapse pattern was detected based on the patient's UTI history.
- Based on the patient's clinical profile and the Ontario College of Pharmacists UTI algorithm, Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals has been selected as the most appropriate first-line treatment option.

### Monitoring & Follow-up
- Take with food
- Monitor for nausea, headache, dark urine

## Executive Summary

This is a 28-year-old woman, non-pregnant, presenting with acute lower urinary tract symptoms characterized by dysuria and urinary urgency. She denies frequency, suprapubic pain, or hematuria, and there are no red flag features such as fever, rigors, flank pain, or gastrointestinal/systemic symptoms. Her medical history reveals no recent antibiotic use, no known medication allergies, no chronic disease, and normal renal function.

Based on her demographic profile and symptom constellation, she meets clinical criteria for acute uncomplicated cystitis with a very high degree of confidence (estimated probability >98%). Algorithmic and clinical review confirms the absence of complicating factors or risk for treatment failure. Empiric therapy with nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID for 5 days is the most appropriate management per current Canadian and international guideline recommendations. Planned follow-up includes symptom reassessment in 48–72 hours, with clear escalation criteria for any emergence of systemic features or lack of clinical improvement.

## Algorithm Alignment

- **Inclusion Criteria Met:**
  - Female, non-pregnant, age 18–65, presenting with ≥1 classic lower urinary tract symptom (dysuria, urgency)
  - Absence of red flags (fever, flank pain, rigors, nausea/vomiting, systemic illness)
  - No recurrent or relapsing UTI pattern
  - No significant medical comorbidity, risk factors for complicated infection, or anatomical abnormalities

- **Exclusion (Complication) Criteria Not Met:**
  - No pregnancy, renal impairment, immunosuppression, catheter use, or urolithiasis
  - No recent (<4 weeks) antibiotic use or UTI treatment failure
  - No known medication allergies

- **Algorithmic Decision:**  
  - **Recommend on-site treatment**: All Ontario College of Pharmacists and Public Health Ontario algorithm elements for acute uncomplicated cystitis are satisfied, and guideline-based therapy is clinically justified without need for deferral or referral.

- **Evidence Alignment:**
  - IDSA (2011, update in progress), NICE (2018), and Public Health Ontario UTI Practice Tool (2023) all explicitly endorse nitrofurantoin as first-line for uncomplicated cystitis in this profile.

## Differential Diagnosis

1. **Acute Uncomplicated Cystitis (most likely):**
   - Classic UTI symptomatology (dysuria, urgency), epidemiologic risk profile, no complicating features, and absence of vaginal or systemic symptoms support diagnosis.

2. **Urethritis:**
   - Considered due to dysuria; less likely in absence of urethral discharge, high-risk sexual exposure, or persistent/worsening symptoms. Reconsider if clinical course is atypical or STIs are a concern.

3. **Vaginitis (Candida, Trichomonas, BV):**
   - Less probable; no vaginal pruritus, discharge, or odor. Maintain as a reserve diagnosis pending symptom progression/evolution.

4. **Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome:**
   - Unlikely: lacks chronicity, pelvic pain, negative recurrence history.

5. **Genital Herpes:**
   - Unlikely: no lesions, vesicles, vulvar pain; however, rare cases may present with dysuria alone—monitor for evolving cutaneous symptoms.

6. **Asymptomatic Bacteriuria:**
   - Effectively ruled out given presence of symptomatic illness; only relevant in screen-positive populations (e.g., pregnant individuals, pre-urologic procedures).

## Therapeutic Plan & Justification

### Recommended Regimen
- **Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals 100 mg PO BID × 5 days**

### Rationale
- **Clinical Safety:** No contraindications—normal renal function (required for efficacy and to prevent toxicity), non-pregnant, no allergy, no G6PD deficiency suggested.
- **Guideline Concordance:** Endorsed as first-line by IDSA (2011), NICE (updated 2018), and Ontario regional guidelines (2023).
- **Resistance Patterns:** Nitrofurantoin maintains excellent activity (Ontario E. coli resistance <5%), preserving broader-spectrum agents. No recent prior antibiotic exposure reported.
- **Risk Factor Assessment:** Young, healthy, with no recurrent or complicated UTI risk—maximizing efficacy, minimizing adverse outcomes.
- **Patient Adherence:** Short (5-day), well-tolerated regimen with proven non-inferiority to alternatives and fewer ecological impacts.

### Alternatives Considered (Not Selected)
- **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole:** Not selected due to higher resistance rates in Ontario and lack of prior urine culture supporting use.
- **Fosfomycin trometamol:** Acceptable alternative; typically reserved for sulfonamide/nitrofurantoin intolerance or G6PD deficiency.
- **Fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin):** Not recommended due to broad-spectrum effects, high rates of collateral damage, and stewardship considerations.
- **Beta-lactams (amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime):** Lower efficacy and higher recurrence risk compared to nitrofurantoin.
- **Referral:** Not required; no systemic signs, treatment failures, or risk factors for upper tract involvement or complicated infection.

## Safety Review Summary

- **Pharmacist Safety Screening:**  
  - **Risk Level:** Low
  - **Reviewed Flags:** None present (normal renal, no allergy, non-pregnant)
  - **Contraindications:** None identified. Renal function normal, no known G6PD deficiency, not in late third-trimester pregnancy.
  - **Drug Interactions:** None present (no current medications; only probenecid/sulfinpyrazone would be concerning).
  - **Monitoring:** Oral nitrofurantoin is very safe for short durations in this demographic; rare but serious risks (e.g., pulmonary, hepatic, neurologic) are extremely uncommon in younger adults and further mitigated by absence of comorbidities.

- **Rationale for Final Treatment Plan:**
  - All safety markers passed; benefits of targeted, short-course therapy outweigh minimal risks. Adherence and patient education will be emphasized to optimize outcomes.

## Monitoring & Follow-up

- **Assessment Timeline:**  
  - Clinical reassessment at 48–72 hours for symptom improvement or adverse effects.
- **Specific Monitoring:**
  - Monitor for persistence or worsening of lower urinary symptoms or any development of fever, flank/back pain, rigors, or systemic illness.
  - Instruct on identification and immediate escalation for symptoms of hypersensitivity (rash, respiratory symptoms, jaundice, new-onset neurologic symptoms).
- **Escalation Triggers:**  
  - Any emergence of red flag features (fever, flank pain, rigors)
  - Lack of symptom improvement or symptom progression after 48–72 hours of therapy
  - Development of upper tract or systemic features
- **Routine Lab Monitoring:**  
  - Not required due to low-risk status and short course.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Pharmacist will complete detailed documentation and inform supervising physician/NP per protocol.

## Patient Counseling

1. **Explain Diagnosis & Rationale:** Acute bladder infection (UTI/acute cystitis) confirmed based on symptoms and lack of complicating features.
2. **Medication Instructions:** Take nitrofurantoin 100 mg by mouth every 12 hours for 5 days. Always take with food to minimize stomach upset and enhance absorption.
3. **Symptom Timeline:** Most patients notice improvement within 24–48 hours; complete the full 5-day course even if symptoms resolve.
4. **Expected Side Effects:** Common (but generally mild) effects include nausea, headache, and darkening of urine (benign). Less commonly, rash or mild GI upset may occur.
5. **Rare Side Effects:** Notify a provider promptly if experiencing rash, shortness of breath, persistent cough, new or worsening jaundice (yellow skin/eyes), or numbness/tingling.
6. **When to Seek Urgent Care:** Immediate attention for fever, chills, back/flank pain, vomiting, systemic symptoms, or absence of clinical improvement after 48–72 hours.
7. **Adherence Importance:** Complete the course—do not stop even if symptoms disappear.
8. **Food/Drug Interaction Counseling:** Avoid antacids containing magnesium trisilicate while on nitrofurantoin (may decrease efficacy).
9. **Self-Care Tips:** Maintain hydration, avoid bladder irritants (caffeine, alcohol) during recovery.
10. **Contact/Access:** Provide direct contact information for pharmacist/clinic for query or escalation.
