### Algorithm Rationale
- This patient presents with complicating factors that preclude pharmacist-initiated antibiotic therapy: male sex, which increases complexity and risk of complications.
- According to the Ontario College of Pharmacists UTI assessment algorithm, patients with any complicating factors should be referred to a physician or nurse practitioner for comprehensive evaluation and management.
- These factors increase the risk of treatment failure, complications, and the need for alternative diagnostic approaches or specialized antimicrobial regimens.
