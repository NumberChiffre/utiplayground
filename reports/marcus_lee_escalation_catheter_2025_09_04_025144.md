# Plan Summary â€” Marcus Lee Escalation Catheter

## Summary
Decision: refer_complicated
Consensus: Escalate to human (interrupt)

### Key Reasoning
- The patient is a 45-year-old male with classic lower urinary tract symptoms (dysuria, urgency, frequency, suprapubic pain) consistent with a urinary tract infection; however, the presence of an indwelling urinary catheter categorizes this as a catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI), which is inherently a complicated UTI.
- Male sex is an independent risk factor for complicated UTI and increases the likelihood of atypical pathogens, more severe disease, and the need for individualized management beyond standard protocols for uncomplicated UTI.
- Absence of systemic red flags (no fever, flank pain, rigors, or hemodynamic instability) currently suggests no evidence of pyelonephritis or sepsis, but complicating factors justify prompt further evaluation to avert progression and adverse outcomes.
- The lack of recent antibiotic exposure, immunocompromised state, or drug allergies simplifies empiric consideration but does not outweigh the need for referral due to structural and demographic complicating factors.
- Pharmacist-initiated empiric therapy is not supported in this scenario given the increased risk of multidrug-resistant organisms and the need for possible urine culture, imaging, and specialist input.

### Algorithm Rationale
- This patient presents with complicating factors that preclude pharmacist-initiated antibiotic therapy: male sex, which increases complexity and risk of complications, abnormal urinary tract function or structure including indwelling catheter, neurogenic bladder, renal stones, or renal dysfunction.
- According to the Ontario College of Pharmacists UTI assessment algorithm, patients with any complicating factors should be referred to a physician or nurse practitioner for comprehensive evaluation and management.
- These factors increase the risk of treatment failure, complications, and the need for alternative diagnostic approaches or specialized antimicrobial regimens.
