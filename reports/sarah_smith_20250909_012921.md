## Summary
Decision: recommend_treatment
Consensus: Nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID x 5 days
Prescriber Sign-off Required: Yes
Safety: approve (low)

### Key Reasoning
- The patient is a 28-year-old non-pregnant female presenting with acute onset dysuria and urinary urgency, which are classic symptoms of lower urinary tract infection (cystitis) according to established diagnostic algorithms.
- She has no fever, flank pain, rigors, nausea, vomiting, or systemic symptoms, which effectively rules out pyelonephritis and other complicated UTI presentations.
- Her renal function is normal, and she has no history of recent antibiotic use, drug allergies, or immunocompromising conditions, supporting the safety and appropriateness of first-line oral therapy.
- There are no urinary catheters, kidney stones, or structural abnormalities reported, further supporting an uncomplicated UTI diagnosis.
- She has no history of recurrent UTIs or recent relapse, which reduces the likelihood of resistant organisms and supports the use of standard first-line agents.
- Absence of red flag symptoms means outpatient management is appropriate, with clear escalation criteria if symptoms worsen or new systemic features develop.

### Algorithm Rationale
- This patient meets the diagnostic criteria for acute uncomplicated cystitis based on their symptom presentation.
- No complicating factors were identified that would preclude pharmacist-initiated treatment.
- No recurrence or relapse pattern was detected based on the patient's UTI history.
- Based on the patient's clinical profile and the Ontario College of Pharmacists UTI algorithm, Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals has been selected as the most appropriate first-line treatment option.

### Monitoring & Follow-up
- Take with food
- Monitor for nausea, headache, dark urine

# Clinical Diagnosis & Treatment Brief: Acute Uncomplicated UTI (Cystitis)  
**Patient:** 28-year-old female, non-pregnant, normal renal function  
**Region:** Ontario, Canada

## Executive Summary

This case involves a 28-year-old non-pregnant female presenting with acute onset dysuria and urinary urgency, classic symptoms of lower urinary tract infection (UTI), specifically uncomplicated cystitis. She denies fever, rigors, flank pain, suprapubic pain, hematuria, nausea, vomiting, or systemic features, and has no history of recurrent or relapsing UTIs. Her renal function is normal, and she is not currently taking any medications, nor does she have any allergies or immunocompromising conditions.

Based on the clinical presentation and absence of complicating factors, the most likely diagnosis is acute uncomplicated cystitis. The management plan is to initiate nitrofurantoin macrocrystals 100 mg PO BID for 5 days, which aligns with current evidence-based guidelines (IDSA 2011, NICE 2018, Public Health Ontario 2023) and regional resistance patterns. Outpatient management is appropriate, with explicit instructions for monitoring, follow-up within 48–72 hours, and clear escalation criteria should red flag symptoms develop.

## Algorithm Alignment

- **Symptom Criteria:**  
  - Dysuria and urgency present; frequency absent but not required for diagnosis.
  - No suprapubic pain or hematuria, but these are not mandatory for diagnosis.
- **Red Flags:**  
  - No fever, rigors, flank pain, nausea, vomiting, or systemic symptoms; pyelonephritis and complicated UTI effectively ruled out.
- **Risk/Exclusion Criteria:**  
  - No pregnancy, immunosuppression, recent antibiotics, or urinary tract abnormalities.
  - Normal renal function (no contraindication to nitrofurantoin).
  - No recurrent or relapsing UTI history.
- **Algorithm Outcome:**  
  - Meets criteria for pharmacist-initiated treatment of uncomplicated cystitis.
  - **Decision:** Treat with first-line oral therapy (nitrofurantoin).
  - **Justification:** Supported by IDSA, NICE, and Public Health Ontario guidelines; low risk for resistant organisms or complications.

## Differential Diagnosis

1. **Uncomplicated Acute Cystitis**  
   - *Most likely*: Classic lower urinary tract symptoms (dysuria, urgency) in a healthy young woman; absence of systemic/upper tract features.
2. **Vaginitis (Candida, Trichomonas, BV)**  
   - *Less likely*: Dysuria can occur, but absence of vaginal discharge, irritation, or odor argues against.
3. **Urethritis (Chlamydia, Gonorrhea)**  
   - *Possible but less likely*: No urethral discharge, sexual risk factors, or vaginal symptoms.
4. **Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome**  
   - *Unlikely*: No chronic pain, frequency, or long-standing symptoms; acute onset not typical.
5. **Pyelonephritis**  
   - *Ruled out*: No fever, flank pain, nausea, vomiting, or systemic illness.
6. **Herpetic Infection**  
   - *Unlikely*: No external lesions, severe pain, or recurrent pattern.

## Therapeutic Plan & Justification

- **Selected Regimen:**  
  - **Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals 100 mg PO BID x 5 days**
- **Rationale:**  
  - *Efficacy*: High cure rates for E. coli and common uropathogens.
  - *Safety*: Favorable profile in young, healthy adults with normal renal function.
  - *Stewardship*: Narrow spectrum, low ecological impact, preserves broader agents.
  - *Regional Resistance*: Ontario surveillance shows low resistance to nitrofurantoin.
  - *Patient Factors*: No allergies, normal renal function, no pregnancy, no recurrence.
  - *Adherence*: Short course, twice-daily dosing, minimal side effects if taken with food.
- **Alternatives Considered:**  
  - **Fosfomycin**: Single dose, but less data on efficacy in North America; reserved for intolerance or contraindication to nitrofurantoin.
  - **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole**: Not selected due to regional resistance >20% in some areas and higher risk of adverse effects.
  - **Fluoroquinolones/Beta-lactams**: Not recommended for uncomplicated cystitis due to broader spectrum, higher ecological impact, and adverse effect profile.
- **Rejection Rationale:**  
  - Broader agents reserved for complicated cases or documented resistance/intolerance.

## Safety Review Summary

- **Risk Level:** Low
- **Key Safety Flags:**  
  - Contraindicated in significant renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m²)—not present.
  - Avoid in late pregnancy—patient not pregnant.
  - Rare risk of pulmonary reactions and peripheral neuropathy—minimal with short course and no risk factors.
- **Contraindications:**  
  - Absolute: Renal impairment, hypersensitivity, prior cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction with nitrofurantoin.
  - Relative: G6PD deficiency—no risk factors identified.
- **Drug Interactions:** None relevant (no current medications).
- **Safety Impact:**  
  - No contraindications or interactions; regimen fully approved.
  - Most common side effect: GI upset—mitigated by taking with food.
  - No routine labs required for short course in healthy adults.

---

## Monitoring & Follow-up

- **Monitoring Actions:**  
  - Assess symptom improvement and side effects within 48–72 hours of therapy initiation.
  - Monitor for new or worsening respiratory symptoms (rare pulmonary toxicity).
  - Advise reporting of hypersensitivity (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing).
  - Monitor for GI side effects; recommend administration with food.
- **Follow-up Timeline:**  
  - Reassess at 48–72 hours post-initiation.
- **Escalation Triggers:**  
  - Fever, rigors, or systemic symptoms.
  - Worsening or non-improving symptoms after 48–72 hours.
  - Development of upper urinary tract or systemic disease (flank pain, vomiting).

## Patient Counseling

1. **Expect symptom improvement within 48–72 hours; complete the full 5-day course even if feeling better.**
2. **Take nitrofurantoin with food to reduce stomach upset and improve absorption.**
3. **Common side effects include mild nausea, headache, or dark urine; these are generally not harmful.**
4. **Report any rash, itching, swelling, or difficulty breathing immediately—these may indicate an allergic reaction.**
5. **Seek urgent care if you develop fever, chills, back/flank pain, vomiting, or if symptoms worsen after 2–3 days.**
6. **Rarely, nitrofurantoin can cause breathing problems or numbness/tingling—report these symptoms promptly.**
7. **Do not use antacids containing magnesium trisilicate while on nitrofurantoin, as they may reduce effectiveness.**
8. **No need for urine culture unless symptoms persist or worsen; follow up as directed.**
9. **If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, but do not double up.**
10. **Maintain good hydration and personal hygiene to support recovery and reduce recurrence risk.**
