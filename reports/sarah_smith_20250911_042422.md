# Plan Summary — Sarah Smith

## Summary
Decision: recommend_treatment
Consensus: Nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID x 5 days
Prescriber Sign-off Required: Yes
Safety: approve (low)

### Key Reasoning
- The patient presents with symptoms consistent with acute uncomplicated cystitis, specifically dysuria and urgency, and lacks systemic symptoms or red flags for complicated UTI or pyelonephritis.
- Her age and normal renal function support the use of nitrofurantoin as an appropriate first-line agent given its efficacy in young women without any contraindications.
- Absence of recent antibiotic use and typical risk factors for resistance makes her a good candidate for standard empiric treatment.
- The absence of recurrent infections in her history suggests that this is an isolated episode, favoring typical treatment duration without the need for extended therapy.
- No indication based on her clinical status necessitates imaging or referral for further urological assessment given the uncomplicated nature of the presentation.

### Algorithm Rationale
- This patient meets the diagnostic criteria for acute uncomplicated cystitis based on their symptom presentation.
- No complicating factors were identified that would preclude pharmacist-initiated treatment.
- No recurrence or relapse pattern was detected based on the patient's UTI history.
- Based on the patient's clinical profile and the Ontario College of Pharmacists UTI algorithm, Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals has been selected as the most appropriate first-line treatment option.

### Monitoring & Follow-up
- Take with food
- Monitor for nausea, headache, dark urine

### Diagnosis Brief
# Acute Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection: Clinical Diagnosis & Treatment Brief

## Executive Summary

A 28-year-old female from Ontario presents with symptoms of dysuria and urgency, consistent with acute uncomplicated cystitis. She exhibits no systemic symptoms or red flags indicating a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) or pyelonephritis. Her renal function is normal, and she reports no allergies or recent antibiotic use. These factors, combined with the absence of a recurrent UTI history, lead to a confident diagnosis of acute uncomplicated cystitis.

The recommended management plan involves Nitrofurantoin 100 mg taken orally twice daily for 5 days. This recommendation is based on guideline support from the Ontario College of Pharmacists and aligned with evidence-based practices targeting uncomplicated UTIs. Nitrofurantoin is selected due to its effectiveness against common uropathogens and its favorable safety profile in this patient population.

## Algorithm Alignment

- **Patient Presentation**: The patient exhibits classic symptoms of dysuria and urgency without systemic involvement.
- **Algorithm Compliance**: The patient's presentation maps onto criteria for acute uncomplicated cystitis per the Ontario College of Pharmacists algorithm, which supports pharmacist-initiated treatment in such cases.
- **Decision**: Initiate treatment with Nitrofurantoin due to the absence of complicating factors and normal renal function.

## Differential Diagnosis

1. **Acute Uncomplicated Cystitis**: The most probable diagnosis due to the typical presentation without systemic symptoms.
2. **Vaginitis**: Less likely, given the absence of vaginal discharge or irritation.
3. **Urethritis**: Possible but unlikely without indicative sexual history or urethral discharge.
4. **Pyelonephritis**: Ruled out by the absence of fever, flank pain, or systemic signs, which would necessitate additional diagnostics and treatment escalation.

## Therapeutic Plan & Justification

### Recommended Treatment

- **Medication**: Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals 100 mg PO BID
- **Duration**: 5 days

### Rationale

- **Agent Selection**: Nitrofurantoin is effective against E. coli, the most common uropathogen, and shows minimal resistance in acute uncomplicated cystitis.
- **Safety Profile**: Favorable in young women with normal renal function, lacking significant contraindications or potential drug interactions.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was considered but rejected due to broader resistance patterns in the region.

## Safety Review Summary

- **Contraindications**: Contraindicated in severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min).
- **Drug Interactions**: None identified due to the lack of concurrent medications.
- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring for side effects, particularly gastrointestinal, is advised.
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Approval Recommendation**: Regimen approved based on comprehensive assessment and alignment with guidelines.

## Monitoring & Follow-up

- **Monitoring Plan**: 
  - **Symptoms**: Evaluate for symptom resolution and adverse reactions at 48-72 hours.
  - **Lab Parameters**: None indicated unless complications arise.
- **Escalation Triggers**: 
  - **Fever or systemic symptoms**
  - **Worsening symptoms after 48-72 hours**
  - **Development of flank pain**

## Patient Counseling

1. **Treatment Expectations**: Improvement typically noticed within 48-72 hours.
2. **Side Effects**: Common side effects include nausea and headache; advise taking with food.
3. **Medication Instructions**: Take as prescribed, with food, to enhance absorption and minimize GI upset.
4. **When to Seek Care**: Seek urgent care for new fever, flank pain, or if symptoms worsen.
5. **Duration of Treatment**: Complete the entire course, even if symptoms improve before finishing.
