## Summary
Decision: recommend_treatment
Consensus: Nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID x 5 days
Prescriber Sign-off Required: Yes
Safety: approve (low)

### Key Reasoning
- The patient is a 28-year-old non-pregnant female with acute onset dysuria and urinary urgency, fulfilling the cardinal symptom criteria for acute uncomplicated cystitis per guideline algorithms.
- The absence of fever, flank pain, nausea/vomiting, or systemic symptoms strongly argues against complicated UTI, pyelonephritis, or urosepsis, and there are no triggers for urgent medical referral or escalation at this time.
- Her normal renal function makes nitrofurantoin an optimal first-line choice, as this agent is both safe and effective in patients with eGFR >30 mL/min and does not require dosage adjustment for mild-moderate renal impairment.
- No recent history of antibiotic use, nor any risk factors for multidrug-resistant organisms or complicated infection, reduces concern for resistant uropathogens and supports standard empiric therapy.
- She has no medication allergies, is not immunocompromised, and has no indwelling devices or history of urolithiasis, further supporting guideline-based treatment with short-course oral therapy in the community setting.

### Algorithm Rationale
- This patient meets the diagnostic criteria for acute uncomplicated cystitis based on their symptom presentation.
- No complicating factors were identified that would preclude pharmacist-initiated treatment.
- No recurrence or relapse pattern was detected based on the patient's UTI history.
- Based on the patient's clinical profile and the Ontario College of Pharmacists UTI algorithm, Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals has been selected as the most appropriate first-line treatment option.

### Monitoring & Follow-up
- Take with food
- Monitor for nausea, headache, dark urine

### Diagnosis Brief
# Acute Uncomplicated UTI – Clinical Diagnosis & Treatment Brief

## Executive Summary

This case concerns a 28-year-old non-pregnant female from Ontario presenting with acute dysuria and urinary urgency. She denies suprapubic pain, hematuria, fever, flank pain, rigors, gastrointestinal symptoms, or known risk factors for complicated infection. Her prior antibiotic exposure, urologic history, and medication profile are unremarkable, and pregnancy has been excluded. Renal function is normal.

The clinical syndrome strongly aligns with acute uncomplicated cystitis, and the overall likelihood of a non-infectious etiology or complicating factors is extremely low (clinical confidence ~98%). In the absence of red flag features or risk markers for multidrug-resistant organisms, a standard five-day course of nitrofurantoin (100 mg PO BID) has been recommended. This approach reflects best practices for safety, efficacy, and stewardship, as identified in contemporary Canadian and international guidelines. Rigorous follow-up within 48–72 hours is advised to reassess for early treatment failure or escalation.

## Algorithm Alignment

- **Symptoms**: Patient reports classic features of lower urinary tract infection—acute-onset dysuria and urgency—meeting key entry criteria for uncomplicated cystitis algorithms (IDSA 2010, NICE NG109, Public Health Ontario).
- **Exclusion criteria**:
  - **No fever, rigors, systemic toxicity, or flank pain**: Argues against upper tract infection (pyelonephritis) or complicated UTI.
  - **No pregnancy, catheter, immunocompromise, urolithiasis, or recent antibiotics**: Confirms straightforward, low-risk profile.
  - **Normal renal function**: Permits safe nitrofurantoin use (eGFR >30 mL/min).
- **Decision node outcome**: Meets all clinical criteria for pharmacist/primary care-initiated empiric oral therapy without need for immediate referral or further diagnostic testing.
- **Guideline concordance**: The management aligns with tier-one evidence/guidelines and is reinforced by local resistance data indicating continued nitrofurantoin efficacy for *E. coli*.

**Resulting Decision:** Treat empirically with nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID x 5 days; monitor, with clear escalation parameters.

## Differential Diagnosis

1. **Uncomplicated acute bacterial cystitis**
   - **Strongly supported**: Cardinal symptoms, rapid onset, young female, absence of complicating/prolonged symptoms.
2. **Vaginitis (Candida, Trichomonas, BV)**
   - **Considered but unlikely**: No vaginal discharge, odor, or irritation; lacks features of vulvovaginal inflammation.
3. **Urethritis (STI-related, e.g., *Chlamydia*, *Gonorrhea*)**
   - **Less likely**: Absence of discharge, genital irritation, history or physical findings suggestive of sexually transmitted infection.
4. **Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome**
   - **Low probability**: Acute symptom onset; lacks chronic pelvic pain, negative prior evaluations.
5. **Herpes simplex virus infection**
   - **Unlikely**: No external lesions, severe pain, or sexual risk markers.
6. **Other causes—rare: Non-infectious irritants, early malignancy**
   - **Very low probability**: No supporting history or exam findings.

## Therapeutic Plan & Justification

**First-Line Selection:**
- **Agent**: Nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO twice daily x 5 days.
- **Justification**: 
  - High efficacy for *E. coli* and typical uropathogens, minimal collateral damage.
  - Favorable safety profile—renally appropriate; low risk for Clostridioides difficile or drug resistance emergence.
  - The five-day duration is validated for optimal microbiologic and clinical cure (IDSA, NICE, Ontario data).
  - No allergy, G6PD deficiency, or pregnancy risk; no drug interactions, supporting agent selection.
- **Alternatives considered, not selected**:
  - **SMX-TMP**: Avoided due to rising resistance rates and adverse reactions.
  - **Fosfomycin**: Excellent alternative but reserved for documented allergy or resistance concerns, cost/access issues.
  - **Fluoroquinolones/Beta-lactams**: Broader spectrum, guideline-reserved for intolerance/failure/culture-driven scenarios due to higher ecological impact.

**Regional context**: Ontario surveillance confirms continued nitrofurantoin activity against community *E. coli* (>90% susceptibility); local and international guidelines endorse therapy.

## Safety Review Summary

**Pharmacist Risk Assessment:** Low risk for adverse events.
- **Key safety screening**:
  - **Renal function (absolute requirement)**: Confirmed normal.
  - **Allergy, hypersensitivity**: None reported.
  - **G6PD deficiency**: No risk suspected.
  - **Pregnancy**: Negative, eliminating neonatal hemolytic risk.
- **Common side effects**: Nausea, headache, mild GI distress—mitigated if taken with food.
- **Rare toxicities**: Pulmonary (interstitial pneumonitis), hepatotoxicity, hypersensitivity—all discussed and monitored.
- **Interactions**: None with patient’s profile.
- **Safety-based plan**: Approved—renally safe, narrow spectrum, and aligns with all screening standards.

## Monitoring & Follow-up

- **Monitoring actions**:
  - **Symptom resolution**: Assess in 48–72 hours (phone or in-person).
  - **Side effects/adverse reactions**: Relayed at follow-up and through direct patient report.
  - **Lab monitoring**: Baseline/ongoing renal function if new symptoms emerge or if clinical status changes.
  - **Escalation triggers**:
    - Persistent/worsening dysuria/urgency after 72 hours
    - Development of fever, rigors, systemic symptoms, or new flank pain (urgent re-evaluation)
    - New rash, breathing difficulty, jaundice (immediate reporting)
- **Plan if improvement**: Complete course, no additional antibiotics/testing unless recurrent/failed response.

## Patient Counseling

1. **Treatment rationale**: This antibiotic is targeted and effective for bladder infections caused by common urinary bacteria.
2. **Expectations**: Most patients experience marked symptom relief within 48–72 hours.
3. **Administration**: Take each dose with food to reduce chance of upset stomach.
4. **Completion**: Finish all 10 tablets, even if symptoms resolve earlier, to ensure full eradication.
5. **Common side effects**: Nausea, mild headache, or loose stool may occur; usually mild and resolve after therapy.
6. **Red flag symptoms**: Contact the clinic or seek care if you develop fever, chills, new back or side pain, rash, or trouble breathing.
7. **Allergy response**: Seek urgent care for facial swelling, severe rash, or difficulty breathing.
8. **Jaundice/urine changes**: If you notice yellowing skin/eyes or dark urine, stop medication and call immediately.
9. **Missed dose**: Take as soon as remembered unless close to next dose—do not double up.
10. **Sexual activity**: Avoid sexual contact until symptoms resolve to reduce risk of spread or irritation.
