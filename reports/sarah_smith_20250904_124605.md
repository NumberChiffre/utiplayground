## Summary
Decision: recommend_treatment
Consensus: Nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID x 5 days
Prescriber Sign-off Required: Yes
Safety: approve (low)

### Key Reasoning
- The patient is a 28-year-old non-pregnant female presenting with dysuria and urgency, which are highly specific and sensitive for acute uncomplicated cystitis according to established diagnostic criteria.
- She denies flank pain, fever, rigors, nausea, or systemic symptoms, ruling out upper urinary tract infection (pyelonephritis) or urosepsis, and there are no signs necessitating escalation of care or referral.
- She has normal renal function, no history of recent antibiotic use, no known allergies, and is not taking any current medications, eliminating major contraindications to preferred first-line agents including nitrofurantoin.
- There is no indication of recurrent or relapsing urinary tract infection based on her clinical history, supporting single-episode management as per guideline recommendations.
- No complicating urologic, immunosuppressive, or anatomical factors are present that would alter management trajectory or mandate specialist assessment; findings are consistent with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection.

### Algorithm Rationale
- This patient meets the diagnostic criteria for acute uncomplicated cystitis based on their symptom presentation.
- No complicating factors were identified that would preclude pharmacist-initiated treatment.
- No recurrence or relapse pattern was detected based on the patient's UTI history.
- Based on the patient's clinical profile and the Ontario College of Pharmacists UTI algorithm, Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals has been selected as the most appropriate first-line treatment option.

### Monitoring & Follow-up
- Take with food
- Monitor for nausea, headache, dark urine

## Executive Summary

A 28-year-old non-pregnant female presents with acute onset dysuria and urinary urgency, classic symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection. There is an absence of systemic or upper tract involvement, including no fever, flank pain, nausea, or rigors. She reports no prior history of recurrent UTI, recent antibiotic exposure, or urologic abnormality. Her renal function is normal, and she is not on any medications or known to have allergies. 

The clinical presentation is highly consistent with acute uncomplicated cystitis. Confidence in this diagnosis is very high given the specificity of her symptoms and the absence of any complicating or atypical features. Current evidence-based guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA, 2010), NICE (2023), and local Ontario recommendations strongly support empiric management in this scenario. The recommended management is a 5-day course of nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID, owing to its efficacy, narrow spectrum, and minimal impact on antimicrobial resistance or C. difficile risk in this healthy, community-dwelling patient. The anticipated outcome is rapid symptom improvement, with follow-up and monitoring to ensure resolution and detect rare but serious adverse drug reactions.

## Algorithm Alignment

**Patient Findings and Algorithmic Criteria Mapping:**
- **Classic Symptoms (dysuria, urgency):** Meets core diagnostic threshold for uncomplicated cystitis.
- **No systemic/upper tract involvement:** Absence of fever, rigors, flank pain, or GI symptoms excludes pyelonephritis or complicated infection per IDSA/NICE/local algorithm.
- **No recent antibiotics, allergies, or comorbidities:** No deviation from empiric first-line approach required.
- **Normal renal function:** Satisfies nitrofurantoin eligibility (eGFR >30 mL/min).
- **No pregnancy:** Avoids pregnancy-specific exclusions.

**Outcome:**  
**Recommend Treatment.** All criteria for pharmacist-initiated empiric therapy are met. This decision is supported by high-level evidence (IDSA 2010, NICE 2023, Ontario Algorithm 2022), with a strong positive predictive value of lower urinary symptoms in a young, otherwise healthy woman. No red flags or complicating features requiring referral are present.

## Differential Diagnosis

1. **Uncomplicated Cystitis**
   - *Ruled in:* Strongly supported by classic symptoms in a young, non-pregnant, immunocompetent adult without systemic features.
2. **Vaginitis (e.g., Candida, bacterial)**
   - *Ruled out:* Absence of vaginal discharge, pruritus, or irritation makes this unlikely.
3. **Urethritis (e.g., STI-related)**
   - *Ruled out:* No urethral discharge, history suggestive of STI risk, or genital lesions.
4. **Pyelonephritis**
   - *Ruled out:* Denied fever, flank pain, and GI symptoms; no CVA tenderness.
5. **Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome**
   - *Ruled out:* Typically chronic with pain out of proportion to UTI symptoms and not associated with acute dysuria only.
6. **Herpetic Genital Infection**
   - *Ruled out:* No external lesions, severe pain, or prodromal symptoms.

## Therapeutic Plan & Justification

**Regimen:**  
- **Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals 100 mg PO BID x 5 days**

**Rationale:**
- *Agent Selection*: Nitrofuran offers targeted activity against common uropathogens (notably E. coli, low resistance rates in Ontario); narrowest spectrum fits stewardship goals.
- *Exclusion of alternatives*: TMP-SMX use is limited by regional resistance rates and allergy risks; fluoroquinolones or β-lactams carry more collateral ecological impact and less favorable adverse effect profiles.
- *Renal function*: Confirmed normal, nitrofurantoin is safe and achieves high intravesical concentrations.
- *No allergies/drug interactions*: Streamlined prescribing.
- *Patient factors*: No recurrence, non-pregnant, reliable for outpatient follow-up.
- *Guideline alignment*: All major guidelines endorse nitrofurantoin as first-line for otherwise healthy, non-pregnant women (IDSA 2010, NICE 2023, OCP 2022).

**Alternatives Considered (not selected):**
- **Fosfomycin**: Single-dose option, but not first preference due to cost, slightly lower efficacy for E. coli, and limited local resistance data.
- **TMP-SMX (Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole)**: High E. coli resistance (>20% locally); not appropriate as empiric first-line in Ontario.
- **Beta-lactams (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalexin)**: Broader spectrum and higher risk of collateral damage.
- **Fluoroquinolones**: Avoided due to high risk of adverse effects and resistance promotion.

## Safety Review Summary

**Pharmacist Review**
- **Risk Level:** Low (ideal candidate, no comorbidities/contraindications).
- **Key Safety Flags:** Monitor for hypersensitivity reactions (rash, urticaria, pruritus, SOB), GI upset, pulmonary/hepatic toxicity (rare: cough, dyspnea, jaundice).
- **Absolute Contraindications:** None present (no allergy, normal renal function, not pregnant/term, not on interacting meds).
- **Drug Interactions:** None identified; no current medications.
- **Impact on Plan:** Reinforced nitrofurantoin as safe and guideline-concordant. Patient to be closely counseled on rare but severe adverse reactions and importance of food co-administration to mitigate GI intolerance.

---

## Monitoring & Follow-up

**Actions:**
- **Symptom assessment** at 48–72 hours: Confirm improvement/resolution of dysuria and urgency.
- **Monitor for red flags:** Fever, rigors, flank pain, systemic features—escalate/refer immediately if present.
- **Adverse events:** Patient instructed to report rash, respiratory symptoms, or jaundice immediately.
- **Duration completion:** Reinforce 5-day course adherence.
- **Post-therapy:** Advise to seek re-evaluation if symptoms recur within several weeks or persist beyond 72 hours.

**Escalation Triggers:**
- **No improvement** after 72 hours
- **Development** of systemic or upper tract symptoms (as above)
- **Signs of hypersensitivity or drug toxicity**

## Patient Counseling

1. **Expectations**: Symptom relief should begin within 24–48 hours; full resolution generally expected by day 5.
2. **Medication instructions**: Take nitrofurantoin with meals to minimize stomach upset and increase absorption.
3. **Course completion**: Finish the entire 5-day course even if symptoms resolve early.
4. **GI symptoms**: Mild nausea is possible; report severe/persistent vomiting or inability to retain oral medication.
5. **Rare side effects**: Seek care immediately for rash, severe fatigue, new cough/SOB, dark urine, jaundice, or right upper abdominal pain.
6. **Red flags warranting urgent care**: Develop fever, chills, persistent vomiting, back/flank pain, or worsening symptoms.
7. **Allergic reactions**: Discontinue and seek immediate medical attention for rash, facial swelling, severe itch.
8. **Adherence**: Stress importance of timely dosing and not sharing/using leftover antibiotics.
9. **Hydration**: Maintain adequate fluid intake, urinating regularly.
10. **Recurrence**: If symptoms return within 2–6 weeks after completion, consult provider—may warrant further work-up.
