# Plan Summary — Sarah Smith

## Summary
Decision: recommend_treatment
Consensus: Nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID x 5 days
Safety: approve (low)

### Key Reasoning
- The patient is a 28-year-old female with classic lower urinary tract symptoms, specifically dysuria and urgency, supporting a diagnosis of acute uncomplicated cystitis per IDSA and local guidelines.
- She has no red flag signs or symptoms such as fever, rigors, flank pain, or systemic illness that would suggest pyelonephritis or sepsis and necessitate escalation or urgent referral.
- There is no recent history of antibiotic use, urinary device, or known urologic abnormality to increase the risk for multidrug-resistant pathogens or complicated infection.
- Her normal renal function and lack of pregnancy or drug allergies allow for safe use of nitrofurantoin, which is recommended as a first-line agent for uncomplicated cystitis given low resistance rates, narrow spectrum, and safety profile.
- No immunosuppression, significant comorbidities, or recurrence were noted, further supporting the safety and appropriateness of empiric pharmacist-initiated treatment without need for culture at this time.
- She demonstrates no recurrence or relapse, so empiric monotherapy is likely to be effective, and the risk of adverse outcomes is low per population outcome data.
- Absence of frequency is somewhat atypical but does not preclude UTI diagnosis; combination of dysuria and urgency has proven high positive predictive value for cystitis.

### Algorithm Rationale
- This patient meets the diagnostic criteria for acute uncomplicated cystitis based on their symptom presentation.
- No complicating factors were identified that would preclude pharmacist-initiated treatment.
- No recurrence or relapse pattern was detected based on the patient's UTI history.
- Based on the patient's clinical profile and the Ontario College of Pharmacists UTI algorithm, Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals has been selected as the most appropriate first-line treatment option.

### Monitoring & Follow-up
- Take with food
- Monitor for nausea, headache, dark urine

### Diagnosis Brief
# Clinical Diagnosis & Treatment Brief: Acute Uncomplicated UTI

## Executive Summary

This case concerns a 28-year-old non-pregnant female from Ontario presenting with acute onset dysuria and urinary urgency, without frequency, hematuria, suprapubic pain, or constitutional symptoms. She denies fever, flank pain, gastrointestinal distress, and any systemic features that might suggest ascending or complicated infection. There is no history of antibiotic use within the past months, prior urinary tract infections in the preceding year, renal dysfunction, drug allergies, pregnancy, catheterization, or immunosuppression.

Her presentation aligns strongly with classic acute uncomplicated cystitis, as supported by symptom constellation and absence of red flags or risk factors for complicated infection. Based on current IDSA, NICE, and Public Health Ontario guidelines, and with strong stewardship rationale, the recommended first-line therapy is nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO twice daily for 5 days. This regimen is optimal for her demographic and risk profile and is favored for its efficacy, low resistance rates (especially in Ontario), favorable safety profile, and minimal ecological impact. Close follow-up within 48–72 hours is advised to ensure symptom resolution and early detection of escalation criteria.

### Mapping of Clinical Findings to Diagnostic/Treatment Criteria

| Algorithm Criterion                          | Patient Finding                                      | Met?      | Explanation                                                                                               |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Classic Lower Tract Symptoms (dysuria, urgency, frequency) | Dysuria and urgency present, frequency absent        | Yes       | Two major symptoms present; high PPV for uncomplicated cystitis even if frequency is absent               |
| Exclusion of Red Flags (fever, flank pain, nausea/vomiting, rigors, systemic sx)        | All explicitly denied                                | Yes       | No evidence of complicated infection or upper tract involvement                                           |

**Resulting Clinical Decision:**  
**Treat**—This patient fully meets all evidence-based criteria for pharmacist-initiated empiric treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis. This action is strongly recommended per IDSA (2011), Public Health Ontario (2017), and NICE (2018) criteria, with no indication for referral, culture, or escalation unless red flags emerge.

## Differential Diagnosis

1. **Acute Uncomplicated Cystitis (Most Probable)**
   - Strongly supported by dysuria and urgency pattern, absence of systemic/complicating features, young female host.
2. **Vaginitis (Bacterial/Fungal)**
   - Lower probability; no vaginal discharge, pruritus, or external irritation.
3. **Urethritis (STI-related, e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea)**
   - Less likely; predominance of urgency, lack of sexual health risk factors, and absence of urethral discharge/pruritus.
4. **Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome**
   - Very low likelihood; acute onset and infectious risk profile do not fit chronic pain syndrome.
5. **Pyelonephritis**
   - Effectively ruled out; no fever, flank pain, nausea/vomiting, or other markers of upper tract/systemic involvement.
6. **Non-infectious Dysuria (Irritant, Medication-induced)**
   - Unlikely given acute infectious symptom cluster and compatible demographic risk.

## Therapeutic Plan & Justification

### Chosen Regimen:
- **Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals 100 mg PO BID x 5 days**

#### Rationale:
- **Efficacy:** High clinical and microbiological cure rates for E. coli and other typical uropathogens in Ontario, with <10% resistance.
- **Safety:** Excellent safety in young, otherwise healthy, non-pregnant females with normal renal function; very low risk for serious adverse events in short-course use.
- **Spectrum/Stewardship:** Narrow-spectrum; avoids collateral gut flora impact and rising resistance seen with fluoroquinolones or beta-lactams. Endorsed by IDSA, NICE, and PHO as first-line for uncomplicated cystitis.
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - **Fosfomycin**: Good alternative, but higher cost, less experience, and lower efficacy for non-E. coli pathogens.
  - **SMX-TMP or Beta-lactams**: Not selected due to higher local resistance rates and broader ecological impact.
  - **Fluoroquinolones**: Avoided due to adverse effects and strong stewardship disincentives (public health and guideline recommendations).
- **Patient factors:** No allergy, drug interactions, adherence barriers/risk factors, or renal compromise. No recurrence or complicating history obviates need for broader-spectrum or IV therapy.
- **Duration:** 5 days—well tolerated, effective, and minimizes resistance per current evidence.

## Safety Review Summary

- **Risk Level:** Low
- **Contraindications:** None present—patient is not pregnant, has normal renal function, and no history of nitrofurantoin allergy or chronic lung disease.
- **Drug Interactions:** None identified; patient is medication-naive.
- **Key Safety Flags:** Rare but serious adverse effects (e.g., hypersensitivity, pulmonary reactions), more relevant with long-term use. Counsel regarding monitoring and when to seek urgent care.
- **Impact on Decision:** All safety criteria confidently met; nitrofurantoin fully approved with no anticipated pharmacological or patient-specific risk.
- **Monitoring Focus:** Prompt symptom resolution, early detection of escalation/complications, rare adverse events.

## Monitoring & Follow-up

**Actions:**
- Contact/assessment at 48–72 hours post-initiation
  - **Goal:** Confirm symptom resolution or improvement; screen for red flags.
- **Red Flags for Escalation:** New/worsening fever, rigors, suprapubic/flank pain, vomiting, persistent/worsening symptoms at 72 hours
- **Parameters:** No routine labs required given patient profile; consider serum creatinine re-assessment only if clinical situation changes.
- **Timeline:** Immediate reporting/triage if escalation criteria are met; otherwise, routine follow-up within 3 days.

## Patient Counseling

1. **Medication Administration:** Take nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily with food to maximize absorption and minimize stomach upset.
2. **Duration:** Complete the full 5-day course, even if symptoms resolve early.
3. **Expected Symptom Resolution:** Symptoms should begin to improve within 24–48 hours; near full resolution expected by day 3–5.
4. **Potential Side Effects:** Mild nausea, gastrointestinal upset, headache, or (harmless) dark yellow/brown urine discoloration.
5. **Serious Adverse Events:** Extremely rare; seek urgent care if you develop rash, shortness of breath, chest pain, severe fatigue, or allergic symptoms.
6. **Escalation Guidance:** Seek immediate care if you develop fever, chills, flank pain, vomiting, persistent pain/worsening symptoms, or any signs of overall unwellness.
7. **Missed Dose:** Take as soon as remembered, but do not double up on doses.
8. **Avoidance:** Do not take antacids containing magnesium trisilicate concurrently, as this can reduce nitrofurantoin effectiveness.
9. **Hydration:** Maintain normal fluid intake; no need to excessively increase fluids.
10. **Communication:** Notify your primary care provider of this episode and follow up as advised.
